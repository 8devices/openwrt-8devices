== User Interface

[[ChUIIntro]]

=== Introduction

Wireshark can be logically separated into the backend (dissecting protocols,
file loading and saving, capturing, etc.) and the frontend (the user interface).

The following frontends are currently maintained by the Wireshark
development team:

* Wireshark, Qt based

* Wireshark, GTK{plus} 2.x based

* Wireshark, GTK{plus} 3.x based

* TShark, console based

There are other Wireshark frontends which are not developed nor maintained by
the Wireshark development team:

* Packetyzer. Native Windows interface, written in Delphi and released
under the GPL. Not actively maintained. https://sourceforge.net/projects/packetyzer/[]

* hethereal Web interface. Not actively maintained and not
finished.

This chapter is focused on the Wireshark frontend, and especially on
the Qt interface.

[[ChUIQt]]

=== The Qt Application Framework

Qt is a cross-platform application development framework. While we mainly use
the core (QtCore) and user interface (QtWidgets) modules, it also supports a
number of other modules for specialized application development, such as
networking (QtNetwork) and web browsing (QtWebKit).

At the time of this writing (September 2016) most of the main Wireshark
application has been ported to Qt. The sections below provide an
overview of the application and tips for Qt development in our
environment.

==== User Experience Considerations

When creating or modifying Wireshark try to make sure that it will work
well on Windows, macOS, and Linux. See <<ChUIGUIDocs>> for details.
Additionally, try to keep the following in mind:

*Workflow*. Excessive navigation and gratuitous dialogs should be
avoided or reduced. For example, the two GTK+ flow graph dialogs have
been combined into one in Qt. Many alert dialogs have been replaced with
status bar messages. Statistics dialogs are displayed immediately
instead of requiring that options be specified.

*Discoverability and feedback*. Most users don't like to read
documentation and instead prefer to learn an application as they use it.
Providing feedback increases your sense of control and awareness, and
makes the application more enjoyable to use. Most of the Qt dialogs
provide a ``hint'' area near the bottom which shows useful information.
For example, the ``Follow Stream'' dialog shows the packet corresponding
to the text under the mouse. The profile management dialog shows a
clickable path to the current profile. The main welcome screen shows
live interface traffic. Most dialogs have a context menu that shows
keyboard shortcuts.

==== Qt Creator

Qt Creator is a full-featured IDE and user interface editor. It makes
adding new UI features much easier. It doesn't work well on Windows at
the present time, so it's recommended that you use it on macOS or Linux.

To edit and build Wireshark using Qt Cretor, open the top-level
'CMakeLists.txt' within Qt Creator. It should ask you to choose a build
location. Do so. It should then ask you to run CMake. Fill in any
desired build arguments (e.g. "-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug" or "-D
ENABLE_GTK3=OFF") and click the ``Run CMake'' button. When that
completes select ``Build â†’ Open Build and Run Kit Selector...'' and make
sure 'wireshark' is selected.

Note that Qt Creator uses output created by CMake's *CodeBlocks*
generator. If you run CMake outside of Qt Creator you should use the
``CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles'' generator, otherwise Qt Creator will
prompt you to re-run CMake.

==== Source Code Overview

Wireshark's `main` entry point is in 'wireshark-qt.cpp'. Command-line arguments
are processed there and the main application class (`WiresharkApplication`)
instance is created there along with the main window.

The main window along with the rest of the application resides in 'ui/qt'. Due
to its size the main window code is split into two modules, 'main_window.cpp'
and 'main_window_slots.cpp'.

Most of the modules in 'ui/qt' are dialogs. Although we follow Qt naming
conventions for class names, we follow our own conventions by separating file
name components with underscores. For example, ColoringRulesDialog is defined in
'coloring_rules_dialog.cpp', 'coloring_rules_dialog.h', and
'coloring_rules_dialog.ui'.

General-purpose dialogs are subclasses of `QDialog`. Dialogs that rely on the
current capture file can subclass `WiresharkDialog`, which provides methods and
members that make it easier to access the capture file and to keep the dialog
open when the capture file closes.

==== Coding Practices and Naming Conventions

===== Names

The code in 'ui/qt' directory uses three APIs: Qt (which uses
InterCapConvention), GLib (which uses underscore_convention), and the Wireshark
API (which also uses underscore_convention). As a general rule Wireshark's Qt
code uses InterCapConvention for class names, interCapConvention for methods,
and underscore_convention for variables, with a trailing_underscore_ for member
variables.

===== Dialogs

Dialogs that work with capture file information shouldn't close just because the
capture file closes. Subclassing `WiresharkDialog` as described above can make
it easier to persist across capture files.

When you create a window with a row of standard ``OK'' and ``Close'' buttons at
the bottom using Qt Creator you will end up with a subclass of QDialog. This is
fine for traditional modal dialogs, but many times the ``dialog'' needs to behave
like a QWindow instead.

Modal dialogs should be constructed with `QDialog(parent)`. Modeless dialogs
(windows) should be constructed with `QDialog(NULL, Qt::Window)`. Other
combinations (particularly `QDialog(parent, Qt::Window)`) can lead to odd and
inconsistent behavior. Again, subclassing `WiresharkDialog` will take care of
this for you.

Most of the dialogs in ui/qt share many similarities, including method names,
widget names, and behavior. Most dialogs should have the following, although
it's not strictly required:

- An `updateWidgets()` method, which enables and disables widgets depending on
  the current state and constraints of the dialog. For example, the Coloring
  Rules dialog disables the *Save* button if the user has entered an
  invalid display filter.
- A `hintLabel()` widget subclassed from `QLabel` or `ElidedLabel`, placed just
  above the dialog button box. The hint label provides guidance and feedback to
  the user.
- A context menu (`ctx_menu_`) for additional actions not present in the
  button box.
- If the dialog box contains a `QTreeWidget` you might want to add your own
  `QTreeWidgetItem` subclass with the following methods:
  `drawData()`:: Draws column data with any needed formatting.
  `colData()`:: Returns the data for each column as a `QVariant`. Used for
    copying as CSV, YAML, etc.
  `operator<()`:: Allows sorting columns based on their raw data.

===== Strings

If you're using GLib string functions or plain old C character array idioms in
Qt-only code you're probably doing something wrong. QStrings are generally
*much* safer and easier to use. They also make translations easier.

If you need to pass strings between Qt and GLib you can use a number
of convenience routines which  are defined in 'ui/qt/qt_ui_utils.h'.

If you're calling a function that returns wmem-allocated memory it might make
more sense to add a wrapper function to 'qt_ui_utils' than to call wmem_free in
your code.

===== Mixing C and $$C++$$

Sometimes we have to call $$C++$$ functions from one of
Wireshark's C callbacks and pass $$C++$$ objects to or from C. Tap
listeners are a common example. The $$C++$$ FAQ link:$$http://www.
parashift.com/c++-faq/mixing-c-and-cpp.html$$:[describes how to do this
safely].

Tapping usually involves declaring static methods for callbacks, passing `this`
as the tap data.

===== Internationalization and Translation

Qt provides a convenient method for translating text: `Qobject::tr()`,
usually available as `tr()`.

However, please avoid using `tr()` for static strings and define them in '*.ui'
files instead. `tr()` on manually created objects like `QMenu` are not
automatically retranslated and must instead be manually translated using
`changeEvent()` and `retranslateUi()`. See 'summary_dialog.[ch]' for an example
of this.

NOTE: If your object life is short and your components are (re)created
dynamically then it is ok to use `tr()`.

In most cases you should handle the changeEvent in order to catch
`QEvent::LanguageChange`.

Qt makes translating the Wireshark UI into different languages easy. To add a new
translation, do the following:

- Add your translation ('ui/qt/wireshark_XX.ts') to 'ui/qt/Makefile.am' and 'ui/qt/CMakeLists.txt'
- (Recommended) Add a flag image for your language in 'images/languages/XX.svg'. Update 'image/languages/languages.qrc' accordingly.
- Run `lupdate ui/qt -ts ui/qt/wireshark_XX.ts` to generate/update your translation file.
- Translate with Qt Linguist: `linguist ui/qt/wireshark_XX.ts`.
- Do a test build and make sure the generated 'wireshark_XX.qm' binary file is included.
- Push your translation to Gerrit for review. See <<ChSrcContribute>> for details.

Alternatively you can put your QM and flag files in the 'languages'
directory in the Wireshark user configuration directory
('$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireshark/languages/' or '$HOME/.wireshark/languages/' on
UNIX).

For more information about Qt Linguist see
http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/linguist-manual.html[its manual].

You can also manage translations online with
https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/wireshark/[Transifex].

Each week translations are automatically synchronized with the source
code through the following steps:

- pull ts from Transifex
- lupdate ts file
- push and commit on Gerrit
- push ts on Transifex

===== Colors

Qt provides a number of colors via the http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qpalette.html[QPalette]
class. Use this class when you need a standard color provided by the
underlying operating system.

Wireshark uses an extended version of the
http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Theme_Guidelines[Tango Color Palette]
for many interface elements that require custom colors. This includes the
I/O graphs, sequence diagrams, and RTP streams. Please use this palette
(defined in `tango_colors.h` and the *ColorUtils* class) if *QPalette*
doesn't meet your needs.

==== Other Issues and Information

The main window has many QActions which are shared with child widgets. See
'ui/qt/proto_tree.cpp' for an example of this.

http://www.kdab.com/kdab-products/gammaray/[GammaRay] lets you inspect
the internals of a running Qt application similar to $$Spy++$$ on Windows.

[[ChUIGTK]]

=== The GTK library

.We have switched to Qt
[NOTE]
====
Wireshark's default interface uses Qt. If you would like to add a new
interface feature you should use it and not GTK{plus}.
The documentation below is primarily historical.
====

Wireshark was initially based on the GTK{plus} toolkit. See
http://www.gtk.org[] for details. GTK{plus} is designed to hide the
details of the underlying GUI in a platform independent way. As GTK is
intended to be a multiplatform tool, there are some drawbacks, as the
result is a somewhat "non native" look and feel.

GTK{plus} is available for many different platforms including, but not limited to:
Unix/Linux, macOS and Win32. It's the foundation of the famous GNOME desktop,
so the future development of GTK should be certain. GTK is implemented in plain
C (as is Wireshark itself), and available under the LGPL (Lesser General Public
License), making it free to used by commercial and noncommercial applications.

There are other similar toolkits like wxWidgets which could also be used for
Wireshark. There's no "one and only" reason for or against any of these
toolkits. However, the decision towards GTK was made a long time ago :-)

There are two major GTK versions available:

[[ChUIGTK2x]]

==== GTK Version 2.x

GTK 2.x depends on the following libraries:

* GObject (Object library. Basis for GTK and others)

* GLib (A general-purpose utility library, not specific to graphical user
  interfaces. GLib provides many useful data types, macros, type conversions,
  string utilities, file utilities, a main loop abstraction, and so on.)

* Pango (Pango is a library for internationalized text handling. It centers
  around the PangoLayout object, representing a paragraph of text. Pango
  provides the engine for GtkTextView, GtkLabel, GtkEntry, and other widgets
  that display text.)

* ATK (ATK is the Accessibility Toolkit. It provides a set of generic interfaces
  allowing accessibility technologies to interact with a graphical user
  interface. For example, a screen reader uses ATK to discover the text in an
  interface and read it to blind users. GTK+ widgets have built-in support for
  accessibility using the ATK framework.)

* GdkPixbuf (This is a small library which allows you to create GdkPixbuf
  ("pixel buffer") objects from image data or image files. Use a
  GdkPixbuf in combination with GtkImage to display images.)

* GDK (GDK is the abstraction layer that allows GTK+ to support multiple
  windowing systems. GDK provides drawing and window system facilities on X11,
  Windows, and the Linux framebuffer device.)

[[ChUIGTK3x]]

==== GTK Version 3.x

Wireshark (as of version 1.10) has been ported to use the GTK3 library.

GTK 3.x depends on the following libraries:

(See GTK 2.x)

[[ChUIGTKCompat]]

==== Compatibility GTK versions

The GTK library itself defines some values which makes it easy to distinguish
between the versions, e.g. +GTK_MAJOR_VERSION+ and +GTK_MINOR_VERSION+ will be
set to the GTK version at compile time inside the gtkversion.h header.

[[ChUIGTKWeb]]

==== GTK resources on the web

You can find several resources about GTK.

First of all, have a look at http://www.gtk.org[]. This
will be the first place to look at. If you want to develop GTK related
things for Wireshark, the most important place might be the GTK API
documentation at http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/stable/[].

Several mailing lists are available about GTK development, see
http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo[], the gtk-app-devel-list may be your
friend.

As it's often done wrong: You should post a mail to *help* the developers
there instead of only complaining. Posting such a thing like "I don't like
your dialog, it looks ugly" won't be of much help. You might think about
what you dislike and describe why you dislike it and provide a suggestion
for a better way.

[[ChUIGUIDocs]]

=== Human Interface Reference Documents

Wireshark runs on a number of platforms, primarily Windows, macOS, and
Linux. It should conform to the Windows, macOS, GNOME, and KDE human
interface guidelines as much as possible. Unfortunately, creating a
feature that works well across these platforms can sometimes be a
juggling act since the human interface guidelines for each platform
often contradict one another. If you run into trouble you can ask the
_wireshark-dev_ mailing list as well as the User Experience Stack
Exchange listed below.

For further reference, see the following:

* Android Design:
http://developer.android.com/design/index.html[]. Wireshark doesn't have
a mobile frontend (not yet, at least) but there is still useful
information here.

* GNOME Human Interface Guidelines:
http://library.gnome.org/devel/hig-book/stable/[]

* The KDE Usability/HIG project:
http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Usability/HIG[]

* macOS Human Interface Guidelines:

[[ChUIGTKDialogs]]

=== Adding/Extending Dialogs

This is usually the main area for contributing new user interface features.

XXX: add the various functions from gtk/dlg_utils.h

[[ChUIGTKWidgetNamings]]

=== Widget naming

It seems to be common sense to name the widgets with some
descriptive trailing characters, like:

* xy_lb = gtk_label_new();

* xy_cb = gtk_checkbox_new();

* XXX: add more examples

However, this schema isn't used at all places inside the code.

[[ChUIGTKPitfalls]]

=== Common GTK programming pitfalls

There are some common pitfalls in GTK programming.

[[ChUIGTKShowAll]]

==== Usage of gtk_widget_show() / gtk_widget_show_all()

When a GTK widget is created it will be hidden by default. In order to
show it, a call to gtk_widget_show() has to be done.


It isn't necessary to do this for each and every widget created. A call
to gtk_widget_show_all() on the parent of all the widgets in question
(e.g. a dialog window) can be done, so all of its child widgets will
be shown too.
