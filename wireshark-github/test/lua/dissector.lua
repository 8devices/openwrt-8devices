-- Version: 2.1
--
-- Changes since 2.0:
--   * fixed a bug with default settings
--   * added ability for command-line to overide defaults
--
-- Changes since 1.0:
--   * made it use the new ProtoExpert class model for expert info
--   * add a protocol column with the proto name
--   * added heuristic dissector support
--   * added preferences settings
--   * removed byteArray2String(), and uses the new ByteArray:raw() method instead
--
-- BACKGROUND:
-- This is an example Lua script for a protocol dissector. The purpose of this script is two-fold:
--   * To provide a reference tutorial for others writing Wireshark dissectors in Lua
--   * To test various functions being called in various ways, so this script can be used in the test-suites
-- I've tried to meet both of those goals, but it wasn't easy. No doubt some folks will wonder why some
-- functions are called some way, or differently than previous invocations of the same function. I'm trying to
-- to show both that it can be done numerous ways, but also I'm trying to test those numerous ways, and my more
-- immediate need is for test coverage rather than tutorial guide. (the Lua API is sorely lacking in test scripts)
--
-- OVERVIEW:
-- This script creates an elementary dissector for DNS. It's neither comprehensive nor error-free with regards
-- to the DNS protocol. That's OK. The goal isn't to fully dissect DNS properly - Wireshark already has a good
-- DNS dissector built-in. We don't need another one. We also have other example Lua scripts, but I don't think
-- they do a good job of explaining things, and the nice thing about this one is getting capture files to
-- run it against is trivial. (plus I uploaded one)
--
-- HOW TO RUN THIS SCRIPT:
-- Wireshark and Tshark support multiple ways of loading Lua scripts: through a dofile() call in init.lua,
-- through the file being in either the global or personal plugins directories, or via the command line.
-- See the Wireshark USer's Guide chapter on Lua (http://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/wsluarm.html).
-- Once the script is loaded, it creates a new protocol named "MyDNS" (or "MYDNS" in some places).  If you have
-- a capture file with DNS packets in it, simply select one in the Packet List pane, right-click on it, and
-- select "Decode As ...", and then in the dialog box that shows up scroll down the list of protocols to one
-- called "MYDNS", select that and click the "ok" or "apply" button.  Voila`, you're now decoding DNS packets
-- using the simplistic dissector in this script.  Another way is to download the capture file made for
-- this script, and open that - since the DNS packets in it use UDP port 65333 (instead of the default 53),
-- and since the MyDNS protocol in this script has been set to automatically decode UDP port 65333, it will
-- automagically do it without doing "Decode As ...".

-- for testing purposes, we want to be able to pass in changes to the defaults
-- from the command line; because you can't set lua preferences from the command
-- line using the '-o' switch (the preferences don't exist until this script is
-- loaded, so the command line thinks they're invalid preferences being set)

-- we don't just want to display our protocol's fields, we want to access the value of some of them too!
-- There are several ways to do that.  One is to just parse the buffer contents in Lua code to find
-- the values.  But since ProtoFields actually do the parsing for us, and can be retrieved using Field
-- objects, it's kinda cool to do it that way. So let's create some Fields to extract the values.
-- The following creates the Field objects, but they're not 'registered' until after this script is loaded.
-- Also, these lines can't be before the 'dns.fields = ...' line above, because the Field.new() here is
-- referencing fields we're creating, and they're not "created" until that line above.
-- Furthermore, you cannot put these 'Field.new()' lines inside the dissector function.
-- Before Wireshark version 1.11, you couldn't even do this concept (of using fields you just created).

local response_field        = Field.new("mydns.flags.response")

-- here's a little helper function to access the response_field value later.
-- Like any Field retrieval, you can't retrieve a field's value until its value has been
-- set, which won't happen until we actually use our ProtoFields in TreeItem:add() calls.
-- So this isResponse() function can't be used until after the pf_flag_response ProtoField
-- has been used inside the dissector.
-- Note that calling the Field object returns a FieldInfo object, and calling that
-- returns the value of the field - in this case a boolean true/false, since we set the
-- "mydns.flags.response" ProtoField to ftype.BOOLEAN way earlier when we created the
-- pf_flag_response ProtoField.  Clear as mud?
--
-- A shorter version of this function would be:
-- local function isResponse() return response_field()() end
-- but I though the below is easier to understand.
