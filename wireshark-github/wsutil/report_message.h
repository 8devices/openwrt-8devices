/* report_message.h
 * Declarations of routines for code that can run in GUI and command-line
 * environments to use to report errors and warnings to the user (e.g.,
 * I/O errors, or problems with preference settings) if the message should
 * be shown as a GUI error in a GUI environment.
 *
 * The application using libwsutil will register message-reporting
 * routines, and the routines declared here will call the registered
 * routines.  That way, these routines can be called by code that
 * doesn't itself know whether to pop up a dialog or print something
 * to the standard error.
