Subject: [PATCH 03/26] OpenPGP: Include private DO to filesystem at driver
 initialization.

In old implementation, the DOs which their access is restricted by
PIN (like DOs 0101 -> 0104) were excluded from the fake filesystem,
leading to that we cannot read their data later, even if we verified PIN.
