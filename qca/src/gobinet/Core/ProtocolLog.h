DESCRIPTION:
   Simple protocol 'log' class declaration
   
PUBLIC CLASSES AND METHODS:
   cProtocolLog
      This class stores protocol buffers in to a flat array (actually a
      double-ended queue) so that they can be accessed by other objects 
      during the flow of normal processing.  Note that the storage is
      in-memory and therefore finite
