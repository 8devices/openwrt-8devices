Compilation Instructions
========================

In order to compile Bluetooth utilities you need following software packages:
        - Linux Bluetooth protocol stack (BlueZ)
        - GCC compiler
        - D-Bus library
        - GLib library
        - Lexical Analyzer (flex, lex)
        - YACC (yacc, bison, byacc)

To install these packages, switch to root previlege.

Fedora Core:
1] Linux Bluetooth protocol stack (BlueZ):
	Download latest source code of BlueZ stack from:
		http://www.bluez.org/download/
2]GCC Compiler:
	=>yum install gcc

3]D-Bus library:
	=>yum install dbus

4]Lexical Analyzer (flex, lex)
	=>yum install flex

5]YACC (yacc, bison, byacc)
	=>yum install byacc bison


Ubuntu:
1] Linux Bluetooth protocol stack (BlueZ):
        Download latest source code of BlueZ stack from:

	=>sudo apt-get install byacc

After downloading these packages please follow README file from bluez source folder to install Bluez stack.

Once BlueZ Stack is installed, go to btconfig folder and give make command to compile btconfig source code:
	=>make 
	
	"btconfig" executable will be genearated

Application usage
=================
