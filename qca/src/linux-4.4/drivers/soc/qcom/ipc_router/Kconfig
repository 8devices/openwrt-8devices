	help
	  IPC Router provides a connectionless message routing service
	  between multiple modules within a System-on-Chip(SoC). The
	  communicating entities can run either in the same processor or
	  in a different processor within the SoC. The IPC Router has been
	  designed to route messages of any types and support a broader
	  network of processors.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config IPC_ROUTER_SECURITY
	depends on IPC_ROUTER
	bool "IPC Router Security support"
	help
	  This feature of IPC Router will enforce security rules
	  configured by a security script from the user-space. IPC Router
	  once configured with the security rules will ensure that the
	  sender of the message to a service belongs to the relevant
	  Linux group as configured by the security script.
