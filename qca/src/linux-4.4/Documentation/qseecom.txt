Available APIs used in Sample App:

QSClient - Client Application in Linux

qseecom.ko is a loadable kernel module which acts as the QTI secure client
in the non-secure world. It provides a sample interface for communication with
the secure world(QSEE).

Multiplication and Crypto functionalities are currently available in the sample
app. Similarly an app can be written to support any required functionalities.

For each platform, memory has been reserved in the QTI default device tree.
For ipq806x, ipq6018, the region is fixed, while it can be changed for ipq807x
and ipq40xx.

Available APIs in kernel which can be reused/extended:

(1) qcom_scm_qseecom_notify	 -> to notify the load region of application
(2) qcom_scm_qseecom_load	 -> to load the libraries and application
(3) qcom_scm_qseecom_send_data	 -> to send data to perform operation
(4) qcom_scm_qseecom_unload	 -> to unload the application and libraries
(5) qcom_scm_tz_register_log_buf -> to register a log buf for sample app logs

Refer to source code in drivers/misc/qseecom.c for re-using the above APIs. This
can be modified or extended to support vendor applications.

Sampleapp Usage Instructions:

Note: We support only 64 bit sampleapp in ipq807x, ipq6018 platform.

Across any platforms, apps can be loaded and functionalities can be performed
securely from the non-secure world via the scm interface. Below are the steps
to load a sample app and perform some basic operations:

Before loading the sample app, the library required by sample app needs to be
loaded.

(1) To load sample app libraries

This step can be skipped if its platform ipq8064 as we use a different
framework. In ipq8064 platform, the libraries are in-built.

This step is needed only for ipq807x, ipq6018, and ipq40xx platforms.

Concatenate all the seg files into 1 segment file and feed it as
input to sys/firmware/seg_file and feed the mdt file as input to
sys/firmware/mdt_file as below:

In platform ipq40xx, the common lib is divided into 4 segments
whereas in platform ipq807x, the common lib is divided into 6 segments.

cat cmnlib.b00 > cmnlib.b0x
cat cmnlib.b01 >> cmnlib.b0x
cat cmnlib.b02 >> cmnlib.b0x
cat cmnlib.b03 >> cmnlib.b0x

Below 2 steps are needed only if its platform ipq807x or ipq6018:

cat cmnlib.b04 >> cmnlib.b0x
cat cmnlib.b05 >> cmnlib.b0x

Now cat the mdt and combined binary files to sysfs entries as below:

cat cmnlib.mdt > /sys/firmware/mdt_file
cat cmnlib.b0x > /sys/firmware/seg_file

echo 0 > /sys/firmware/tzapp/load_start

You will get a print saying you have successfully loaded app libraries.

(2) To load sample app

Concatenate all the seg files into 1 segment file and feed it as
input to sys/firmware/seg_file and feed the mdt file as input to
sys/firmware/mdt_file as below:

In platform ipq8064 or ipq40xx, the sample app is divided into 4
segments whereas in ipq807x, the sample app is divided into 7 segments

cat sampleapp.b00 > sampleapp.b0x
cat sampleapp.b01 >> sampleapp.b0x
cat sampleapp.b02 >> sampleapp.b0x
cat sampleapp.b03 >> sampleapp.b0x

Below 3 steps are required if its platform ipq807x or ipq6018:

cat sampleapp.b04 >> sampleapp.b0x
cat sampleapp.b05 >> sampleapp.b0x
cat sampleapp.b06 >> sampleapp.b0x

Below step is required if its platform ipq6018:

cat sampleapp.b07 >> sampleapp.b0x

Now cat the mdt and combined binary files to sysfs entries as below:

cat sampleapp.mdt > /sys/firmware/mdt_file
cat sampleapp.b0x > /sys/firmware/seg_file

echo 1 > /sys/firmware/tzapp/load_start

(3) Perform operations required in the application

The following mult. operations can be tested in all the platforms:

To give input to Multiplication op:
echo 100 > /sys/firmware/tzapp/basic_data

To view Secure Multiplication output:
cat /sys/firmware/tzapp/basic_data

The following crypto operation can be tested in all platforms other
than ipq806x:

The "crypto" sysfs entry triggers the sample test encryption and decryption
inside secure app and displays the result if the test has passed or failed.

To test Crypto functionality:
echo 1 > /sys/firmware/tzapp/crypto

The following encrypt/decrypt operation can be tested only in
ipq806x platform:

To give input to Encryption:
echo '6bc1bee22e409f9' > /sys/firmware/tzapp/encrypt

To view encryption output:
cat /sys/firmware/tzapp/encrypt

To give input to Decryption:
cat /sys/firmware/tzapp/encrypt > /sys/firmware/tzapp/decrypt

To view decryption output:
cat /sys/firmware/tzapp/decrypt

(4) To unload the sampleapp

echo 2 > /sys/firmware/tzapp/load_start

The libraries used by sample app are automatically unloaded when the device
driver is removed (i.e. during rmmod to remove the qseecom module).

If the user doesn't unload the app, then the app is unloaded when the
device driver is removed.

Note: sampleapp logging has been enabled for QSEE sample app. To view the log at
any point after loading the sample app from kernel, please use below command:

cat /sys/firmware/tzapp/log_buf > log.txt

QSEE APIs in ipq40xx:

In ipq40xx, there are RSA and AES APIs available to perform crypto operations.
The steps to use AES and RSA APIs are as below:

RSA API:

RSA Generate Key blob:
(1) cat /sys/rsa_sec_key/rsa_generate > key_blob.txt

RSA Import Key blob:
(1) cat hex.dat > /sys/rsa_sec_key/rsa_import
(2) cat /sys/rsa_sec_key/rsa_import > import_key_blob.txt

Note:
hex.dat contents must be a properly generated RSA vector.

spec of the hex.dat file used in RSA Import Key blob:
hex.dat size is 1066 bytes.

1066 bytes split up:
	528 bytes -> import modulus
	2 bytes -> import modulus length in hexadecimal
	5 bytes -> public exponent
	1 byte -> public exponent length in hexadecimal
	528 bytes -> private exponent
	2 bytes -> private exponent length in hexadecimal

public, private exponent can be any value other than 3
modulus can be any value lesser than 4096

RSA Sign data:
(1) cat key_blob.txt > /sys/rsa_sec_key/rsa_key_blob
    or
    cat import_key_blob.txt > /sys/rsa_sec_key/rsa_key_blob
(2) cat data.txt > /sys/rsa_sec_key/rsa_sign
(3) cat /sys/rsa_sec_key/rsa_sign > signed_data.txt

RSA Verification of Signature:
(1) cat key_blob.txt > /sys/rsa_sec_key/rsa_key_blob
    or
    cat import_key_blob.txt > /sys/rsa_sec_key/rsa_key_blob
(2) cat data.txt > /sys/rsa_sec_key/rsa_sign
(3) cat signed_data.txt > /sys/rsa_sec_key/rsa_verify
(4) cat /sys/rsa_sec_key/rsa_verify > verification_result.txt
(5) cat verification_result.txt

AES API:

AES Generate Key blob:
(1) cat /sys/sec_key/generate > key_blob.txt

AES Import Key blob:
(1) cat key.txt > /sys/sec_key/import
(2) cat /sys/sec_key/import > imported_key_blob.txt

AES Encrypt data:
(1) cat key_blob.txt > /sys/sec_key/key_blob
    or
    cat imported_key_blob.txt > /sys/sec_key/key_blob
(2) cat data.txt > /sys/sec_key/seal
(3) cat /sys/sec_key/seal > encrypted_data.txt

AES Decrypt data:
(1) cat key_blob.txt > /sys/sec_key/key_blob
    or
    cat imported_key_blob.txt > /sys/sec_key/key_blob
(2) cat encrypted_data.txt > /sys/sec_key/unseal

Note:
RSA generate functionality can take random amount of time to execute. This is
because in this RSA algorithm we have to generate 2 random numbers with certain
properties and then proceed. We can use the RSA import functionality if in case
time is a concern.

shk value is 0 by default in non-secure ipq40xx target systems.

To make the keyblobs target dependent, shk values must be changed from default
value in non-secure target systems.

Without doing this, we will be able to encrypt in one board and decrypt in
another board using the same keyblob.

AES 256 Block cipher API:

Configure AES type:
(1) echo 2 > /sys/sec_key/aes_type
    <1 - SHK, 2 - PHK>

Configure AES mode:
(2) echo 1 > /sys/sec_key/aes_mode
    <0 - ECB, 1 - CBC>

Store plain input text data:
(3) echo -n -e \\x01\\x02\\x03\\x04\\x05\\x06\\x07\\x08 > /sys/sec_key/aes_encrypt
Note:
AES 256 APIs expects data in the form of hex bytes. The input data size has to
multiple of AES block size(16 Bytes) and not more than 2048 Bytes

Import AES IV data:
(4) echo -n -e \\x01\\x02\\x03\\x04\\x05\\x06\\x07\\x08 > /sys/sec_key/aes_ivdata
Note:
AES 256 APIs expects IV data in the form of hex bytes. The IV data size should be
equal to the AES block size(16 Bytes). If IV data is not provided, qseecom
generates one, so this step is optional.

AES 256 encrypt data:
(5) cat /sys/sec_key/aes_encrypt > enc.txt

store encrypted data:
(6) cat enc.txt > /sys/sec_key/aes_decrypt

AES 256 decrypt data:
(7) cat /sys/sec_key/aes_decrypt > dec.txt

Display decrypted data:
(8) hexdump -C dec.txt
