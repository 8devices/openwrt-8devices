Qualcomm IPQ806x SATA PHY Controller
------------------------------------

SATA PHY nodes are defined to describe on-chip SATA Physical layer controllers.
Each SATA PHY controller should have its own node.

Required properties:
- compatible: compatible list, contains "qcom,ipq806x-sata-phy"
- reg: offset and length of the SATA PHY register set;
- #phy-cells: must be zero
- clocks: must be exactly one entry
- clock-names: must be "cfg"

Optional properties:

All of the HSIO properties below should be present for a certain
characterization requirement.
If any one of property is missed, all others are ignored and default HSIO
characterization settings will be used by the driver.
- tx_preemph_gen3: Tx driver de-emphasis value in the case where the PHY is
  running at the gen3 rate
- rx_eq: Fixed value of the RX equalizer
- mpll: mpll settings in MPLL_LOOP_CTL register
- term_off: Termination offset in TX_OVRD_DRV_HI register

Example:
	sata_phy: sata-phy@1b400000 {
		compatible = "qcom,ipq806x-sata-phy";
		reg = <0x1b400000 0x200>;

		clocks = <&gcc SATA_PHY_CFG_CLK>;
		clock-names = "cfg";

		#phy-cells = <0>;

		tx_preemph_gen3 = <0x0F>;
		rx_eq = <0x03>;
		mpll = <0x0>;
		term_off = <0x0>;
	};
