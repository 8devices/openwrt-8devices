This driver configures the crypto engine for IPSec traffic in UBI32.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be qcom,nss-crypto
- reg: Physical address and length of the register set for the device.
- resets: physical address for crypto reset registe
- qcom,ee: Number of interrupt lines(Execution Environments) supported by BAM.

Example:

crypto0: crypto@38000000 {
	»        compatible = "qcom,nss-crypto";
		»        reg-names = "crypto_pbase", "bam_base";
		»        reg = <0x38000000 0x20000>,
		»            <0x38004000 0x22000>;
		»        resets = <&gcc CRYPTO_ENG2_RESET>;
		»        reset-names = "rst_eng";
		»        qcom,ee = <0>;
};
