* Data Capture and Compare (DCC)

DCC (Data Capture and Compare) is a DMA engine, which is used to save
configuration data or system memory contents during catastrophic failure or
SW trigger.
It can also perform CRC over the same configuration or memory space.

Required properties:

- compatible : name of the component used for driver matching, should be
	       "qca,dcc"

- reg : physical base address and length of the register set(s), SRAM and XPU
	of the component.

- reg-names : names corresponding to each reg property value.

Optional properties:

- qca,save-reg: boolean, To save dcc registers state in memory after dcc
		 enable and disable

- qca,data-sink: string, To specify default data sink for dcc, should be one
		  of the following:
		  "atb"	  : To send captured data over ATB to a trace sink
		  "sram"  : To save captured data in dcc internal SRAM.

Example:

	dcc: dcc@4b3000 {
		compatible = "qca,dcc";
		reg = <0x4b3000 0x1000>,
		      <0x4b4000 0x2000>,
		      <0x4b0000 0x1>;
		reg-names = "dcc-base", "dcc-ram-base", "dcc-xpu-base";

		clocks = <&clock_gcc clk_gcc_dcc_ahb_clk>;
		clock-names = "dcc_clk";

		qca,save-reg;
	};
