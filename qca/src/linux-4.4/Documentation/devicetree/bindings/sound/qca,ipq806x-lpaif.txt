qca,ipq806x-lpaif

LPA_IF driver for IPQ806x

Required properties:

  - compatible     : "qca,ipq806x-lpaif"
  - reg		   : should have the pcm register address, length
  - interrupts	   : should have the LPA_IF interrupt number
  - clocks	   : should have the pcm bit clock
  - clock-names    : should be "pcm_bit_clk"
  - resets	   : references to the reset controllers
  - reset-names	   : should be "lcc_pcm_reset"

Example:

lpaif: lpaif@28100000 {
	compatible = "qca,ipq806x-lpaif";
	reg = <0x28100000 0xFFFF>;
	interrupts = <0 85 0>;
	clocks = <&lcc PCM_CLK>;
	clock-names = "pcm_bit_clk";
	resets = <&lcc LCC_PCM_RESET>;
	reset-names = "lcc_pcm_reset";
};
