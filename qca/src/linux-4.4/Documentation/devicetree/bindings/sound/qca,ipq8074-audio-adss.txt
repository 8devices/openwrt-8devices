* Qualcomm Technologies, Inc IPQ8074 ASoC audio subsystem driver

This node models the Qualcomm Technologies, Inc IPQ8074 ASoC audio subsystem driver

Required properties:

- compatible	: "qca,ipq8074-audio-adss"
- reg		: should have the stereo register address, length
- resets	: references to the reset controllers
- reset-names	: should be "blk_rst"

Additionally, for slave mode we require a boolean called "slave;" in the node.

Example:

master:
audio: audio@7700000 {
	compatible = "qca,ipq8074-audio-adss";
	reg = <0x7700000 0x34>;
	resets = <&gcc AUDIO_BLK_ARES>;
	reset-names = "blk_rst";
	status = "disabled";
};

slave:
audio: audio@7700000 {
	compatible = "qca,ipq8074-audio-adss";
	reg = <0x7700000 0x34>;
	resets = <&gcc AUDIO_BLK_ARES>;
	reset-names = "blk_rst";
	status = "disabled";
	slave;
}

If the user wants to use pcm alone and not full fledged audio, and is going to
disable all other audio nodes, then "adss_init" must be added in pcm node as
shown below. Without adding this boolean, pcm will not work because adss_init
will not be done.

Example:

pcm: pcm@7704000 {
	compatible = "qca,ipq8074-pcm";
	reg = <0x7704000 0x2000>;
	adss_init;
	dma-tx-channel = <MBOX3_TX_ID>;
	dma-rx-channel = <MBOX0_RX_ID>;
	stereo-tx-port = <STEREO3_ID>;
	stereo-rx-port = <STEREO0_ID>;
	clocks = <&adss_clk ADSS_AUDIO_PCM_CLK>;
	clock-names = "audio_pcm_clk";
};

Note: When full fledged audio is enabled, ipq_audio_adss_init is done in the
sound card driver probe (ipq_audio_probe).
