QCA Wakeup M3 Remoteproc Driver
=====================================

The IPQ807x family of devices uses a M3 co-processor. The M3
requires a firmware binary to boot. The q6-wcss remoteproc driver handles
the loading of firmware of M3. Q6V5-WCSS is dependent on this M3.

M3 Device Node:
================
A M3 device node is used to represent the M3 processor
instance within the SoC. It is needed as child node to SOC parent node
through which it is accessible to the IPQ807x.

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible:		Should be one of,
				"qca,q6v5-m3-rproc" for IPQ807x SoCs
- firmware:		Name of firmware file to be used for loading and
			booting the q6-wcss remote processor.
- qca,auto-restart      states that q6 is restarted after receiving error fatal
			from q6
- qca,secure		notifies that TZ is used for bringing q6 out of reset

Example:
--------
/* IPQ807x */
q6v5_m3: q6v5_m3 {
	compatible = "qca,q6v5-m3-rproc";
	firmware = "IPQ8074/m3_fw.mdt";
	qca,auto-restart;
	qcom,restart-group = <&q6v5_m3 &q6v5_wcss>;
};
